    "# Example Implementations of dj_spotify\n",
    "\n",
    "This markdown notebook displays the functionality of the ```dj_spotify``` module through a number of examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "First clone this repository. Upon completion, import the module.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from dj_spotify import DJ_Spotify\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will initialize the ```DJ_Spotify``` class using the credentials generated from the app you created at https://developer.spotify.com/. This will allow us to connect to Spotify's API.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dj = DJ_Spotify(client_id='{Your Client ID}',\n",
    "                client_secret='{Your Client Secret}',\n",
    "                spotify_user='{Your Username}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "            \n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "            \n",
    "#### Example 1: Optimally Sorting and Updating a Single Playlist from Your Library\n",
    "I have a playlist called \"Songs for Literally Any Situation\" I would like to have sorted. To do so, I would run the ```sort_playlist()``` function. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "sorted_playlist = dj.sort_playlist(donor_playlist='Songs for Literally Any Situation',\n",
    "                                   sort_mode=3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The ```sort_mode``` parameter quantifies how strictly you would like your playlist to be sorted on a scale from 1 to 3: with 3 being the most strict, and 1 being the most lenient. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: Sorting a Single Playlist with More Variety\n",
    "After sorting a single playlist with ```sort_mode=3``` many times, you may begin to notice the same songs will typically play after each other. This is because the algorithm is sorting the playlist as optimally as possible. Should you want added variety, we can lower the ```sort_mode``` parameter.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sorted_playlist = dj.sort_playlist(donor_playlist='Songs for Literally Any Situation',\n",
    "                                   sort_mode=2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3: Combining Playlists\n",
    "I want to combine my \"Coastal\" playlist with Spotify's \"Beach Vibes\" playlist, as well as one of my friend's \"Summer Fun\" playlist. I first create a new, blank playlist called \"My New Beach Playlist\" and then run the ```combine_playlists()``` function. I will also reference the ```duration_h```, ```energy_filter```, and ```sort_mode``` parameters to make the playlist 6 hours long, contain the most energetic songs from each playlist, and use the most strict sorting algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dj.combine_playlists(donor_playlists={'Coastal': '{My Username}',\n",
    "                                      'Beach Vibes': 'spotify',\n",
    "                                      'Summer Fun': '{My Friends Username}'},\n",
    "                     recipient_playlist='My New Beach Playlist',\n",
    "                     duration_h=6,\n",
    "                     energy_filter=True,\n",
    "                     sort_mode=3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 4: Sorting Many Playlists at Once\n",
    "I would like to re-sort five specific playlists on a routine basis. To do this efficiently, I can use the ```sort_certain_playlists()``` function to name which playlists I would like sorted, and which ```sort_mode``` I would like applied to each.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dj.sort_certain_playlists({'Songs for Literally Any Situation': 2,\n",
    "                           'Groove': 3,\n",
    "                           'Millennia': 1,\n",
    "                           'Miami': 3,\n",
    "                           '80s + Modern Mix': 2})\n",
    "```"
