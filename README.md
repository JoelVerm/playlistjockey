Unlock innovative ways to experience playlists.

### Description
Since the inception of music players, we've always had 3 methods of playback: shuffle, repeat, and repeat once. Frankly, we can do better.

`playlistjockey` unlocks a variety of new ways you can sort and experience your playlists. Select a playlist from your streaming platform of choice, choose a mixing algorithm, and upon reviewing
your playlist's new track order, immediately update and listen to your refreshed playlist. DJs can utilize this package to instantly prepare setlists stored in Tidal.

Happy mixing!

### Playback
When experiencing a playlist that has been sorted by playlistjockey, enable to following suggested Playback settings:
  - **Turn off shuffle** to ensure songs are played in the order in which they were sorted in
  - Maximize the **Crossfade** value for dance and pop playlists, or set to around 4 seconds for rock or other genres
  - If you're using Spotify's mobile app, enable **Gapless Playback** to minimize quiet moments while a playlist is playing

### Methodology

  - **Harmonic mixing:** playing songs with compatible keys together
  - **Beat matching:** playing songs with similar speeds and syncing their beats together
  - **Energy levels:** playing songs with identical intensity levels
